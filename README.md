🛳️ Titanic Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive step-by-step guide for data cleaning and feature engineering using the classic Titanic dataset (train.csv). The Titanic dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks—predicting whether a passenger survived or not—and is ideal for practicing preprocessing techniques crucial in any data science pipeline.

🧠 Objective
The main goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling by:

Handling missing values

Creating new informative features

Encoding categorical variables

Ensuring the data is clean, structured, and ready for model training

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

📂 Dataset
train.csv: Contains passenger information (e.g., age, sex, class) and the target variable (Survived).

🧼 Key Cleaning Steps
Missing Values

Imputed Age using median

Imputed Embarked using mode

Dropped Cabin due to excessive missingness

Verification

Confirmed no remaining missing values

🛠️ Feature Engineering
FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1

IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1 else 0

Title: Extracted from Name, grouped rare titles

AgeGroup: Binned Age into categories (Child, Teen, Adult, Senior)

🧾 Encoding Categorical Variables

Feature	Encoding Method	Notes
Sex	Binary Mapping	0 = male, 1 = female
Embarked	One-Hot Encoding	drop_first=True to prevent multicollinearity
Title	One-Hot Encoding	Optional feature
AgeGroup	One-Hot Encoding	Optional feature
Pclass	Kept as ordinal or One-Hot (your choice)	Discussed in notebook
🧹 Dropped Columns
Name, Ticket, PassengerId: High cardinality / identifiers

Cabin: Dropped during cleaning

SibSp, Parch: Redundant after FamilySize creation

✅ Final Dataset
The final processed DataFrame is:

Numerical or properly encoded

Free of missing values

Rich with new features

Ready for machine learning

📌 How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Place train.csv in the same directory.

Open and run titanic_preprocessing.ipynb step-by-step.

🎓 Key Takeaways
Data preprocessing is essential to ensure model quality.

Feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns.

Cleaning steps must be justified and tailored to each dataset.
